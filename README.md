# Laravel Translator

Laravel Translator is a Python tool designed to facilitate the translation process within Laravel projects. Its main purpose is to scan a Laravel project and extract all translation keys, making it easier for developers to manage and translate language files manually.

## Features

- **Translation Key Extraction**: Scan Laravel projects to extract all translation keys used within the project.
- **Manual Translation**: Assist developers in manually translating the extracted keys into language files.
- **Future Plans**: Integration with online translation services for automatic translations and AI-powered editing of translations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EngALAlfy/laravel_translator.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python translator.py /path/to/your/laravel_project
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/your/laravel_project` with the path to your Laravel project.

## Future Plans

In future updates, we plan to implement the following features:

- Automatic translation using online services.
- AI-based editing of translations to improve accuracy and efficiency.
